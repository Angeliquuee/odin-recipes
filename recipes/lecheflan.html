<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Leche flan is a Filipino dessert that is essentially a caramel custard
    consisting of milk, sugar, and eggs, with the addition of vanilla flavoring.
    Originally, it was brought over to the Philippines during the Spanish colonization,
    so it is believed that it has origins in the regions on the border of Spain and France.
