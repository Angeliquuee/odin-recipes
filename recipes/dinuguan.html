<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Dinuguan (pork blood stew) comes from the root word dugo, or  blood. 
    This dish is so named because it is a stew made with the blood of a freshly-slaughtered pig. 
    In this recipe, the more exotic organ meats are omitted. 
    The stew is cooked with pork belly, cheeks and liver to make dinuguan virgins less squeamish.
    This is a main course or can be a snack paired with rice cakes and serves up to 4 people.

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
    <li>500 grams pork belly (cut into one-inch cubes)</li>
    <li>500 grams pork cheeks (cut into one-inch cubes)</li>
    <li>1/3 cup vinegar</li>
    <li>1 whole head garlic (peeled and minced)</li>
    <li>2 thumbs-sized knobs ginger (peeled and finely chopped)</li>
    <li>2 shallots or one onion (peeled and roughly chopped)</li>
    <li>5 to 6 finger chillies</li>
    <li>Fish sauce (or salt) to taste</li>
    <li>Pepper to taste</li>
    <li>2 to 4 cups fresh pork blood</li>
    <li>1/4 kilogram pork liver thinly sliced</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the cooking oil in a pan.</li>
    <li>Add the pork belly and cheeks, and cook over high heat, stirring often, until the meat is no longer pink.</li>
    <li>Pour in the vinegar. Stir.</li>
    <li>Cook, uncovered, until the vinegar has been absored by the pork, and the pork has started to render fat.</li>
    <li>Cook the pork in the mixture of cooking oil and rendered fat for a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the garlic, shallots (or onion), ginger and chillies.</li>
    <li>Season with fish sauce (or salt) and pepper. Stir. </li>
    <li>Pour in the blood (see notes after the recipe). Stir. Bring it to the boil (the blood will turn red to brown as it cooks).</li>
    <li>Lower the heat, cover and simmer for an hour or until the pork is done.</li>
    <li>The sauce will reduce and thicken as it cooks, don't be tempted to add water unless you want a soupy dinuguan.</li>
    <li>Taste the stew from time to time and adjust the seasonings, as needed.</li>
    <li>When the pork is tender, add the liver. Stir. Simmer another ten minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish the dinuguan with slices of chili and scallions before serving.</li>
    <li>Serve as a main dish with rice, or as a snack with sweet rice cakes.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Notes</h4>
<p>Note that if there are solid masses in the blood, you can press them through a strainer before adding to the pork. I didn't mind the solid masses although I mash them with my hands to make sure that there are no too large pieces</p>
